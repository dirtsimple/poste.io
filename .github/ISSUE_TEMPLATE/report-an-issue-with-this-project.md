> This repository is *only* for issues with the `dirtsimple/poste.io` docker image.  If you are using `analogic/poste.io`, the correct place for that is the [analogic mailserver repo on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/analogic/mailserver/issues/).  Please go there for assistance regarding the standard poste.io image.

You should only be using this repository's image if you

1. do not mind it being relatively out of date, and
2. specifically need one or more of its extra features.

And you should only be reporting an *issue* in this repository if you have a problem with one of the extra features.

(Note: if you don't follow all the instructions in this template, your issue will be closed without comment.)
